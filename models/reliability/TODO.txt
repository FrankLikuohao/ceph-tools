INVESTIGATE:
	
	PL(rep) = PFail(onesite)
	it should be PFail(numsite * onesite)

TEST CASES:

DO:
	asymmetric replication
	   1. investigate multisite: Prados-fail not multipled by survivors
	   2. assuming it is wrong, fix it and add new test case(s)
	   3. keep separate counts for primary/secondary sites/copies
 	      and update descend accordingly
	   4. demonstrate no change with symmetric replication
	   5. add secondary sites to MultiSite and demonstrate difference
	   6. play with it to see when it makes what difference
	   7. add new test cases

	Figure out how to model WAN link availability

    
VALIDATE RESULTS
	test my results vs servethehome.com/raid-calclulator
		they support RAID-0 and get a very different number than I do
		we used to agree on RAID-1 (do we still)
		2+1 ... I say .000124, they say .00052
		6+2 ...	I say 1.6E-9, they say 6E-6
		but they are counting reads and writes, which I should
http://www.servethehome.com/raid-calculator/raid-reliability-calculator-simple-mttdl-model/

	but reconsider what I want to do with it,
	    come up with a new model for what it should be in each
		disk does NRE probability and loss computations
		disk incorporates scrubbing
		?does disk control the nre model?
	    come up with a new code refactoring for who does what
	    implement it

	AND ... there was another calculator


CONSIDER ADD RAID stripes on top of the others

CONSIDER ADD scrubbing and scrub efficacy in eliminating NREs
